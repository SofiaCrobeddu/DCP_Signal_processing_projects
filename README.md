## PURPOSE

The aim of these projects was to learn how to analyze different types of signals, also with a focus on the usage of them in the medical sector. The analysis was performed through Python.

## REPOSITORIES

The repositories are:
- **Assignment 1**: it contains both the Jypiter Notebook and the resport in pdf format of the first assignment.
  - `Ass. 1.ipynb`: contains the analysis about the first assignament of ECG Signal Processing and Analysis. Focus on the acquisition of the ECG signal, some basic characteristics (mean, variance, energy, signal-to-noise ratio), filtering, R-peaks detection through Thresholding technique, RR intervals, Heart rate and Heart rate variability calculation. 
  - `CROBEDDU_SOFIA_NOEMI_Assignment1.pdf`: contains the resport with the interpretation and the explanation of the results of the first assignment.
- **Assignment 2**: it contains both the Jypiter Notebook and the resport in pdf format of the second assignment.
