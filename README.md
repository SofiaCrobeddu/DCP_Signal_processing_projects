# Signal_Image_ComputerVision_projects

This individual projects were carried out for the course of Data capture and processing of the Master's degree in Biometrics and Intelligent vision at Université Paris-est Cretéil during my Exchange semester. They were made during the first semester of the academic year 2024-2025 (September 2024 - January 2025).

## PURPOSE

The aim of these projects was to learn how to analyze different types of signals, also with a focus on the usage of them in the medical sector. The analysis was performed through Python.

## REPOSITORIES

The repositories are:
- **Assignment 1**: it contains both the Jypiter Notebook and the resport in pdf format of the first assignment.
  - `Ass. 1.ipynb`: contains the analysis about the first assignament of ***ECG Signal Processing and Analysis***. Focus on the acquisition of the ECG signal, calculation of some basic characteristics (mean, variance, energy, signal-to-noise ratio), filtering, R-peaks detection through Thresholding technique, RR intervals, Heart rate and Heart rate variability calculation. 
  - `CROBEDDU_SOFIA_NOEMI_Assignment1.pdf`: contains the report with the interpretation and the explanations of the results of the first assignment.
- **Assignment 2**: it contains both the Jypiter Notebook and the resport in pdf format of the second assignment.
  - `Ass. 2.ipynb`: contains the analysis about the second assignament of ***Speech Processing in Frequency domain Using Periodogram***. Focus on speech acquisition, calculation of some basic characteristics (duration, sampling frequency, mean, energy), spectrum analysis through Power Spectral Density, periodogram, Windowing (Boxcox, Hamming, Hanning), dominant frequencies and variation of sampling frequency and window length.
  - `CROBEDDU_SOFIA_NOEMI_Assignment2.pdf`: contains the report with the interpretation and the explanations of the results of the second assignment.
